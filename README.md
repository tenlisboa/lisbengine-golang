This is a ongoing hobby project created with C++ and OpenGL, the purpose is getting knowledge
and have fun programming things from scratch.

It is not a Bootcamp guided project or something that are produced in courses or books.

The project is being created with no previous knowledge in Graphics Programing (This is a Graphics 'Poorgraming')

The sources of knowledge for this fun project is being extracted from the book [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com), GoLang docs and many forums such as StackOverflow and Reddit.
